ContraDB
========
(Whenever I finish this behemoth, it will be) a Django database of contradance choreographies with a handful of different search and display options, an easy interface to add dances, and a parser that turns human-notated dances into the data models that my database needs.

(Also, when it's done, it will be pretty. This is decidedly not pretty. I know how to make pretty websites, I promise.)

([What is contradance](//www.sbcds.org/contradance/whatis/), you ask? A [high-energy partnered American folk dance](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_dance) somewhere between English country dance and square dance. So what am I storing in here? Short answer: dances, which are collections of a handful of basic dance moves, combined and recombined and modified in all sorts of whacky ways.)
